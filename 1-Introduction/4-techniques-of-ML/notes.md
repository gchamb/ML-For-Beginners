## Notes:

`feature` - The input/s of the model and typically the column heads of your data. A measurable property.

> Ex: The color, size, weight 

`target` - The output/s fo the model and the answer of the question you are asking. 

> Ex. The **price** of a given neighborhood during winter

### Choosing Features

`feature selection` -  A subset of the original features

`feature extraction` - derived from the original features

### Splitting Data

`Training` - Training data should take up majority of the split and used to actually train the model. 

`Testing` - Testing data should be the portion of the data that is used to actually test your model 

`Validation` - Validation data should be the portion of the data that is used to tune your model further based on the results of your testing.
